# NutriVisionTracker

Calorie counting and nutrient tracking are crucial for sportspeople as they directly impact performance,
recovery, and overall health. Additionally, tracking nutrients ensures athletes consume an adequate
balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, essential for muscle repair, energy production, and immune
function. However, the process can be tedious, especially when dining out or eating pre-prepared meals
where exact nutritional information is often unavailable. Calorie-counting apps can help with this task,
yet they still rely heavily on user input and estimation, making it challenging to accurately measure intake.
The necessity for improved nutritional labelling serves as an excellent use case for the latest advancements
in OpenAIâ€™s models capable of processing vision inputs.

This project was created as a part of the course Computer Vision Systems Programming in WS2023 at TU Wien.
